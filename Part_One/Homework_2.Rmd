Read data into R which was pulled from lab google drive.
Include all libraries required for analysis and cleaning
To read data in I used read_csv from the readr package which is apart of the tidyverse.
I didn't need to use a skip due to the format of the data and the first row being the column names. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
cfus <- read_csv("/Users/burtonkarger/Documents/r_course_19/Part_One/CFU_Counts.csv",
                      col_names = TRUE)
head(cfus, n = 3)

```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
ggplot(cfus) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = Timepoint, y = CFU, color = Organ)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Timepoints (Days)", y = "CFU (colony forming units)") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 58) +
  ggtitle("M. Smegmatis CFU counts for all timepoints")
```
